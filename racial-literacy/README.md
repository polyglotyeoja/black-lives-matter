## Ally          
Describes someone who supports a group other than one's own (in terms of racial identity, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) Allies acknowledge disadvantage and oppression of other groups; take risks and supportive action on their behalf; commit to reducing their own complicity or collusion in oppression of those groups, and invest in strengthening their own knowledge and awareness of oppression (Center for Assessment and Policy Development; Racial Equity Tools, 2019). When thinking of the term “Ally”, Ta-Nehisi Coates states, "I think one has to even abandon the phrase 'ally' and understand that you are not helping someone in a particular struggle; the fight is yours." Roxane Gay adds: “We need people to stand up and take on the problems borne of oppression as their own, without remove or distance. We need people to do this even if they cannot fully understand what it's like to be oppressed for their race or ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, or other marker of identity.”

## Anti-Black Racism/Anti-Blackness
The personal, cultural, social, legal, and structural attacks on people with dark skin. This term highlights the unique and disproportionate amount of racism that Black people face. This term is unique because colorism, white supremacy, and structural racism work in tandem to specifically marginalize Black people. Anti-Blackness is not limited to Black people, it impacts all dark-skinned people.

## Colorblindness
The racial ideology that suggests that the best approach to racism is to disregard racial differences and treat everyone equally, regardless of race (“I don’t see color”). Colorblindness reinforces a perspective that race is insignificant, does not limit a person's opportunities, and does not matter. It ignores race, racism, and the social, historical, and present effects they have, including the cultural wealth of communities of color (Ansell; Yosso, 2005).  

## Colorism
Colorism refers to discrimination based on skin color. Colorism disadvantages dark-skinned people while privileging those with lighter skin. Research has linked colorism to lower incomes, lower marriage rates, longer prison terms, and fewer job prospects for darker-skinned people (Hall, 2014; Hunter, 2007). This stems from racial hierarchies where white skin or whiteness (viewed as superior, intelligent, beautiful, civilized, pure, ideal, normal, etc) is juxtaposed against Black skin or Blackness (viewed as subordinate, incompetent, ugly, deviant, different, other). All communities, including communities of color, are susceptible to colorism.  

## Critical Consciousness
The ability to recognize, analyze, and critique systems of inequity, and the commitment to take action against these systems (El Amin, et. al, 2007; Ladson-Billings, 1995)

## Dysconscious Racism
Refers to an uncritical habit of mind (including perceptions, attitudes, assumptions, and beliefs) that justifies inequity and exploitation by accepting the existing order of things as a given. Is the unquestioned acceptance of problematic norms and privileges (King & Akua, 2012).  

## Equality
Equality is commonly defined as providing the same opportunities for everyone. The problem is that equality does not take into consideration historical and contemporary forms of discrimination, such as racism, which privilege white people at the expense of people of color.

## Equity
Recognizes historical and contemporary oppression and acknowledges that different communities require different types and levels of support to succeed and survive. To achieve equity, policies and procedures may require unequal distribution of resources to redress disparities and disadvantages and achieve equal outcomes.  

## Implicit Bias
Refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. They cause us to have feelings and attitudes about other people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, age, and appearance. They develop over the course of a lifetime beginning at a very early age through exposure to direct and indirect messages, including through early life experiences, the media and news programming (Kirwan Institute, 2015).

## Individual Racism
Refers to an individual discriminatory beliefs, assumptions, or behaviors (Henry & Tator, 2006).  Includes examples such as telling a racist joke or using hate speech. Individual racism is connected to broader socio-economic histories and processes and is supported and reinforced by systemic/structural racism. The U.S. cultural narrative about racism typically focuses on individual racism and fails to notice structural racism. Racism is often seen as a psychological bias that can be cured rather than an embedded structural problem that is indefinite.  

## Intersectionality
According to Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw (who coined the term),"Intersectionality is simply a prism to see the interactive effects of various forms of discrimination and disempowerment. It looks at the way that racism, many times, interacts with patriarchy, heterosexism, classism, xenophobia — seeing that the overlapping vulnerabilities created by these systems actually create specific kinds of challenges. “Intersectionality 102,” then, is to say that these distinct problems create challenges for movements that are only organized around these problems as separate and individual. So when racial justice doesn’t have a critique of patriarchy and homophobia, the particular way that racism is experienced and exacerbated by heterosexism, classism etc., falls outside of our political organizing—it means that significant numbers of people in our communities aren’t being served by social justice frames because they don’t address the particular ways that they’re experiencing discrimination."

## Micro-affirmation
Rowe (2008) coined the term micro-affirmation, and explained that it comprises small gestures extended on a daily basis that foster inclusion, listening, comfort, and support for people who may feel unwelcome or invisible in an environment. For example, because of the common experiences of Black students at Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs), micro-affirmations can be utilized to communicate important messages that students are welcome, visible, and capable of performing well, which lead to a greater sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and resiliency to persist despite the challenges faced (Powell, Demetriou, & Fisher, 2013). 

## Microaggressions
Dr. Chester Pierce coined and defined microaggressions as: "subtle, stunning, often automatic and nonverbal exchanges which are put-downs of Black people." Psychologist Derald Wing Sue (2007) expanded the definition to include “everyday verbal, non-verbal and environmental slights, snubs or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.” Microaggressions can be seen in jokes, low expectations, insults, assaults and everyday practices of belittlement, exclusion, and invalidation of people of color.

## Race
Race is a social, political, and legal construct created by white people to further their economic and political interests at the expense of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of color across the globe. Although race is not biologically grounded or natural, it has very real implications regarding the current and historical marginalization of Black and Brown communities because of institutional racism. Race is not to be confused with ethnicity; your race is determined by how you look, while your ethnicity is determined based on the social and cultural groups you belong to (Fanon, 1952). The fundamental difference is that race is socially imposed, hierarchical, and inequitable (Conely).

## Racism
Laws, institutions, and policies working in tandem with individual and group level processes to reproduce white supremacy and racial inequity (Claire & Dennis, 2015). 

## Stereotype
A fixed, preconceived, and oversimplified idea or set of beliefs about a person or group. Stereotypes can either be positive or negative, and are based on an inaccurate understanding and generalization that all people with a particular characteristic are the same.

## Systemic/Structural Racism
A historical and present system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations and other norms work in various, often reinforcing ways to perpetuate racial inequity specifically against Black and Brown communities. Can be seen in discriminatory laws, residential segregation, poor health care, inferior education, unequal economic opportunity, and the exclusion and distortion of the perspectives of people of color in cultural institutions. It is the most profound and pervasive form of racism, and all other forms of racism emerge from structural racism (Lawrence & Keheler, 2018). White supremacy is at the core of systemic racism.   

## White Privilege
White privilege refers to the unquestioned and unearned set of advantages, entitlements, benefits, and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white (Racial Equity Tools, 2013; McIntosh, 1989). Generally, white people who experience such privilege do so without being conscious of it. White privilege is not the suggestion that white people have never struggled or had it hard, but that race/skin color is not one of the things making it harder.

## White Supremacy
The preferential norms, laws, treatment, privilege, power, access and opportunities that benefit white people at the expense of cumulative and chronic outcomes for Black and Brown communities. It is infused in all aspects of our society which include our laws, history, education system, culture, and entire social fabric.
